# VOO-Analysis
Trying to determine the best day of the week to invest in the VOO

## Data
This data is pulled from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOO/history. In this analysise we are looking at data from from the past 13 years. 

## Analysis/Conclusion
This analysis consists of two methods. Method 1, looks at the average dip per day in the VOO. This proved that Monday had the greatest average diof -0.04. Method 2 used a backtester method. This method uses a function that took inputs of the amount of money invested and which day to simulate the amount of money you would have if you consistenly invested on a particular day of the week. This showed that Thurdays yielded the highest earnings.
